    <h2>How Long to Cook Green Bean Casserole ?
    </h2>
    <h4>In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, this canned green bean casserole should be perfectly cooked in about 10 minutes. Of course, that
         doesn't include the 5-8 minutes the ingredients spend in the microwave!</h4>
    <h2>Can You Make Green Bean Casserole Ahead of Time?
    </h2>
    <h4>Yes! You can bake this green bean casserole up to three days in advance. Cook it according to the recipe, but leave off the French-fried onions.
         Allow it cool, cover tightly with foil, and refrigerate until you're ready to eat.</h4>
